Decimal-To-Binary Converter

This is a simple code to convert decimal numbers to binary. It runs a Node.js server, so you can easily convert a decimal number through a browser.

How to install?

Clone this project, and then initiate npm with the 'npm init -y' command. You need Node.js installed to do this.
Then, just run 'npm install express' to install the necessary modules.

How to run?

Just run 'node index.js' and your server is running. It's really lightweight, so you can leave it running.

How to use it?

It runs on localhost using the port 3000. So you just need to open your browser and type the URL 'http:localhost:3000/to-binary/<decimal_that_you_wanna_convert_to_binary>'. It will give you the binary in response.
NEW FEATURE: now you can also convert decimal numbers to hexadecimal with the URL 'http:localhost:3000/to-hex/<decimal_that_you_wanna_convert_to_hex>'.

Really easy!
