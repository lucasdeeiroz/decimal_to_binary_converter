Decimal-To-Binary Converter

This is a simple code to convert decimal numbers to binary. It runs a Node.js server, so you can easily convert a decimal number through a browser.

How to run?

Just run 'node index.js' and your server is running. It's really lightweight, so you can leave it running.

How to use it?

It runs on localhost using the port 3000. So you just need to open your browser and type the URL 'http:localhost:3000/to-binary/<decimal_that_you_wanna_convert_to_binary>'. It will give you the binary in response.
